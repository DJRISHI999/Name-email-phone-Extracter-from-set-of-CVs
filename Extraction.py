
'''You need to write a code which extracts emailID, contact no. and overall text from CVâ€™s and then can be downloaded in .XLS format. 

-	share a working link of your program(not code), where input will be a bundle of CV and output would be excel containing above said information.
-	Sharing code through Git/Email would not be entertained
-	You can use any framework you are comfortable with
Upload your code on any free server and share a working link. Please check if your link is accepting proper input and giving expected output before sharing the link.'''
